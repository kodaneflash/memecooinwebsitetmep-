Let the social links section. This needs to be a visual timeline shaped like a winding galactic booty with me first explore the current codebase to understand how the social links section is structured and where to add this new section.

I'll need to:
1. Look at the humorous milestone events.

Let me first understand the current structure by current layout structure
2. Find where the social links section is
3. looking at the relevant files:

1. I need to see the current landing page structure
2. Find where the social links are locate Create a new Roadmap component styled as a "d
3. Understand the designBooty Map"
4. Design it as consistency patterns
4. Create a new a visual timeline shaped like a winding galactic booty
5. Add humorous milestones like "First Galactic roadmap component that fits the theme

Let me start by exploring Ass-Clap achieved!"

Let me start by examining the main the current page structure and the social links section. page structure and the social links section.</details></think>

I'll help you add a "Booty Map"

I'll help you add a "Booty Map" roadmap section below the social links. Let me first explore the current structure to understand where to add this new section.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure. The Socials component is before the Footer, so I need to add the new Booty Map section after Socials but before Footer. Let me also check the Socials component to understand its design pattern.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I can see the current structure. I need to:

1. Create a new Roadmap component that fits the theme
2. Add it to the page.js file after the Socials component
3. The design should be consistent with the existing theme - using cosmic colors, the Stopbuck font, and the playful/humorous tone

Let me also check the tailwind config to see what colors are available:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the structure. I need to create a new Roadmap component that will be styled as a "Booty Map" with a visual timeline shaped like a winding galactic booty. Let me also check the design patterns by looking at other components to understand the color scheme and typography.</details></think>

Read file: app/globals.css

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to create a "Booty Map" roadmap component. Looking at the existing design patterns:

1. The page uses the Stopbuck font for headings
2. Colors are cosmic-pink, cosmic-coral, cosmic-cyan, cosmic-purple
3. Each section has a divider with emojis and gradient lines
4. The design is playful and humorous

I'll create a roadmap component that:
1. Uses a winding/curved timeline design (like a galactic booty shape)
2. Has humorous milestone events
3. Follows the existing color scheme and typography
4. Is placed after the Socials component

Let me create the Roadmap component first:</details></think>

Now I'll create a "Booty Map" roadmap component that follows the design consistency and add it to the page. Let me create the roadmap component first:

Perfect! I've successfully added the "Booty Map" roadmap section to your landing page. Here's what I implemented:

## ‚úÖ **New "Booty Map" Section Added**

**üéØ Location**: Positioned below the "Jiggleverse" social links section with a matching divider

**üé® Design Features**:
- **Winding Timeline**: A galactic booty-shaped visual timeline with gradient colors
- **Humorous Milestones**: 6 phases with playful names like "First Galactic Ass-Clap Achieved!" and "The Great Galactic Twerk-Off"
- **Interactive Elements**: Cards that glow and animate based on completion status
- **Alternating Layout**: Events alternate left and right for a dynamic winding effect

**üåà Design Consistency**:
- Uses the same `font-stopbuck` font for headings
- Maintains the cosmic color scheme (pink, coral, cyan, purple)
- Includes the signature text-shadow effects
- Features the same section divider pattern with emoji (üçë) and gradient lines
- Responsive design matching the existing components

**üìç Roadmap Phases**:
