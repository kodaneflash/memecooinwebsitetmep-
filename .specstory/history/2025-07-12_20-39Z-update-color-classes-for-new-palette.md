<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to update the color classes in globals.css to use bright, energetic neon colors. Looking at the current globals.css file, I need to identify where colors are defined and replace them with the new neon color palette.

From the file, I can see several color definitions:
1. CSS custom properties in `:root` - currently using white/black color scheme
2. The `.text-shadow` class uses `#201a17` (dark brown/black)
3. The `.text-shadow-duis` and `.text-shadow-duis-not-hover:not(:hover)` classes use `#eac837` (yellow/gold)
4. The `.cloud` class uses `#e4e0e1` (light gray)

The user wants:
- Electric purples
- Vibrant blues  
- Glowing pinks
- Cosmic greens

I should replace these colors with neon equivalents. Let me plan the color mapping:

1. Background/foreground colors: Use dark background with bright neon foreground
2. Text shadows: Use bright neon colors instead of the current dark brown and yellow
3. Cloud background: Use a neon color

Let me choose some specific neon colors:
- Electric purple: #8A2BE2 or #9D4EDD or #BF40BF
- Vibrant blue: #0080FF or #1E90FF or #00BFFF
- Glowing pink: #FF1493 or #FF69B4 or #FF00FF
- Cosmic green: #00FF00 or #39FF14 or #00FF80

I'll update the CSS with these bright neon colors.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I've updated the root color variables. Now I need to update the text shadow colors to use the neon palette. The current text-shadow class uses a dark brown color, and the text-shadow-duis classes use a yellow/gold color. I'll replace these with bright neon colors.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the text-shadow-duis classes to use a different neon color. I'll use a vibrant blue for these.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the other text-shadow-duis class that has the :not(:hover) selector. I'll use the same vibrant blue color for consistency.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Finally, I need to update the cloud background color to use a neon color. I'll use a glowing pink for this.</details></think>

3. **Text shadow duis classes**: Changed from yellow/gold to vibrant blue (`#00bfff`)
