_**User**_

For the hero section at the very top, due to me not having the assets ready to use for this section we neeed rto make a temporary hero section that includes a cta right below it in smaller letters 'Join the jiggle revolution‚Äîintergalactic booty-powered economics' with the telegram and X icon, call-to-action: ‚ÄúReady to join the jiggle-verse?‚Äù  $JIAT  MAKE IT appealing, follow design consistency.  Make it extremely appealing and clean. 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to create a temporary hero section for their meme coin landing page. They want it to be appealing, clean, and follow design consistency. Let me understand what they need:

1. A hero section at the top with:
   - A call-to-action "Ready to join the jiggle-verse?"
   - The token symbol $JIAT
   - A subtitle with "Join the jiggle revolution‚Äîintergalactic booty-powered economics"
   - Telegram and X (Twitter) icons
   - Should be appealing, clean, and follow design consistency

I need to look at the current Hero component to understand the existing structure and styling, then modify it to create this temporary hero section. Let me also check the current design patterns used in the project by looking at other components.

First, let me examine the current Hero component and some other components to understand the design system.</details></think>

---

I'll help you create a temporary hero section that's appealing and follows your design consistency. Let me first examine your current Hero component and design patterns to understand the styling approach.

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/Hero.js

---

Read file: app/globals.css

---

Read file: components/icons/index.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I can see the design patterns:

1. Color scheme:
   - Background: #0a0a0a (dark)
   - Foreground: #FB2AA3 (cosmic pink)
   - Accent peach: #FE6040 (cosmic coral)
   - Accent cyan: #06E3F5 (cosmic cyan)
   - Purple: #9d4edd

2. Typography:
   - Custom font "Stopbuck" is available
   - Text shadows are used for styling effects

3. Available icons:
   - Telegram and X icons are available

4. Current Hero is basically empty, just a full height div

Now let me check the Telegram and X icons to understand their structure:</details></think>

---

Read file: components/icons/Telegram.js

---

Read file: components/icons/X.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me check one more thing to see if there are any existing components that show the typical styling patterns used in this project:</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/About.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the design patterns used in this project. Let me analyze the key design elements:

1. **Typography**: 
   - `font-stopbuck` is used for headings
   - `font-mono` is used for body text  
   - Large text sizes (text-6xl, text-5xl, text-4xl)
   - Tracking-widest for body text

2. **Colors**:
   - `text-cosmic-pink` (#FB2AA3)
   - `text-cosmic-coral` (#FE6040) 
   - `text-cosmic-cyan` (#06E3F5)
   - `bg-cosmic-gradient` (gradient combination of the colors)
   - `text-transparent bg-clip-text` for gradient text effects

3. **Layout**:
   - `max-w-[85rem]` for container width
   - `mx-auto` for centering
   - `px-4 py-10 sm:py-14` for padding

4. **Styling patterns**:
   - Large, bold text with gradient effects
   - Italics for emphasis
   - Underlines with cosmic colors
   - Text shadows available via CSS classes

Now I'll create an appealing temporary hero section that follows these patterns. The hero should:
- Have a compelling headline "Ready to join the jiggle-verse?"
- Show the token symbol $JIAT prominently
- Include the subtitle "Join the jiggle revolution‚Äîintergalactic booty-powered economics"
- Have Telegram and X icons
- Follow the cosmic color scheme and typography
- Be visually appealing and clean

Let me create this now:</details></think>

---

Now I'll create an appealing temporary hero section that follows your design consistency. Based on your existing components, I can see you use the Stopbuck font, cosmic color gradients, and specific spacing patterns.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've created a beautiful temporary hero section that follows the design consistency of the project. Let me also check if there are any custom Tailwind classes I need to add to make sure the cosmic colors work properly. Let me check the tailwind config to make sure all the cosmic colors are properly defined.</details></think>

---

Read file: tailwind.config.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The Tailwind config has all the cosmic colors properly defined. The temporary hero section I created is now complete and follows all the design patterns:

1. **Typography**: Uses `font-stopbuck` for headings and `font-mono` for body text
2. **Colors**: Uses the cosmic color palette with gradients
3. **Layout**: Uses the standard container width and spacing patterns
4. **Interactive elements**: Social icons with hover effects and transitions
5. **Animations**: Includes bouncing emojis and pulsing background elements
6. **Accessibility**: Proper aria-labels and semantic HTML

The hero section includes:
- Main CTA: "Ready to join the jiggle-verse?" with a cosmic gradient
- Token symbol: $JIAT prominently displayed with text shadow
- Subtitle: "Join the jiggle revolution‚Äîintergalactic booty-powered economics"
- Social icons: Telegram and X with hover effects
- Decorative elements: Bouncing emojis and subtle background animations

The design is clean, appealing, and consistent with the existing project aesthetic. The user should be able to see this immediately when they run their Next.js app.</details></think>

Perfect! I've created a beautiful temporary hero section that follows your design consistency. Here's what I've implemented:

## üéØ **Hero Section Features:**

**Main Elements:**
- **Primary CTA**: "Ready to join the jiggle-verse?" with a cosmic gradient text effect
- **Token Symbol**: $JIAT displayed prominently with the cosmic cyan text shadow
- **Subtitle**: "Join the jiggle revolution‚Äîintergalactic booty-powered economics"
- **Social Icons**: Telegram and X with interactive hover effects

**Design Consistency:**
- Uses your `font-stopbuck` for headings and `font-mono` for body text
- Follows your cosmic color palette (`cosmic-pink`, `cosmic-coral`, `cosmic-cyan`)
- Maintains your standard container width (`max-w-[85rem]`) and spacing patterns
- Uses your existing text shadow effects (`text-shadow-duis`)

**Interactive Elements:**
- Social icons with gradient backgrounds and hover animations
- Bouncing emoji decorations (üçëüöÄüåô) with staggered animations
- Subtle pulsing background stars for cosmic ambiance
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with responsive text sizes
- Proper spacing and layout across all screen sizes
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

The hero section is now ready and will display a clean, appealing temporary design that matches your project's aesthetic. You'll need to update the social media links (`https://t.me/your-telegram` and `https://twitter.com/your-x`) with your actual URLs when you're ready.

The design maintains the intergalactic theme with cosmic colors, space-themed animations, and the playful "jiggle" branding while being professional and visually striking! üöÄ

_**User**_

dont add new styling to the  social icons the contrast is bad use the styling the social icons already have like at bottom of page in @Socials.js   and remove the üçë
üöÄ
üåô emojis  and is there anyway to make the eixsting animated space background appear through the gradient overlay you added whilst still showing the gradient? the space backgorund is working, your gradient just  is on top of it in the hero section area, i  see it below

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:

1. Use the existing social icon styling from the Socials.js component instead of the new styling I added
2. Remove the bouncing emoji decorations (üçëüöÄüåô)
3. Make the existing animated space background show through the gradient overlay while still keeping the gradient visible

Let me first look at the LinkCardCircle component to see how the social icons are styled there, then update the Hero component accordingly.</details></think>

---

I'll fix those issues by using the existing social icon styling and adjusting the background to show the animated space background through the gradient overlay.

---

Read file: components/LinkCardCircle.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the existing social icon styling. It uses:
- `bg-[#3d332b]` background
- `border-4 border-duis` (which is the cosmic cyan color)
- `text-white` for the icon color
- Hover effects that swap the background and border colors
- `group-hover:scale-125` for scaling
- `rounded-full` for the circular shape
- `p-2 sm:p-4` for padding

I need to update the Hero component to:
1. Use this existing styling for the social icons
2. Remove the bouncing emoji decorations
3. Adjust the gradient overlay to be more transparent so the space background shows through

I'll also need to import the LinkCardCircle component or recreate the same styling inline.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've made the requested changes:

1. **Fixed social icons**: Now using the exact same styling as the existing LinkCardCircle component with:
   - `bg-[#3d332b]` background
   - `border-4 border-duis` (cosmic cyan border)
   - `text-white` for icons
   - Hover effects that swap colors and scale up
   - Same responsive sizing and padding

2. **Removed emoji decorations**: Completely removed the bouncing üçëüöÄüåô emojis

3. **Made gradient overlay more transparent**: Changed from `opacity-95` to using alpha channels (`/40` and `/60`) so the space background can show through while still providing some contrast for text readability

4. **Updated social links**: Used the actual Telegram link from the Socials component and kept the X link consistent

The space background should now be visible through the more transparent gradient overlay while still maintaining good text contrast and readability. The social icons now match the existing design system perfectly.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:

## ‚úÖ **Updates Made:**

1. **Social Icons**: Now using the exact same styling as your existing `LinkCardCircle` component:
   - Brown background (`bg-[#3d332b]`)
   - Cosmic cyan border (`border-4 border-duis`)
   - White icons with hover effects that swap colors
   - Scale animation on hover (`group-hover:scale-125`)

2. **Removed Emoji Decorations**: Completely removed the bouncing üçëüöÄüåô emojis

3. **Transparent Gradient Overlay**: Changed from `opacity-95` to using alpha channels (`from-black/40 via-gray-900/60 to-black/40`) so your animated space background can show through while still providing enough contrast for readable text

4. **Updated Links**: Used the actual Telegram link from your Socials component (`https://t.me/jiatscommunity`)

Now the animated space background will be visible through the hero section while maintaining good text readability, and the social icons perfectly match your existing design system! The space background should now be visible throughout the hero area instead of being completely covered by the gradient overlay.

add another ca input, same one as already in @ContractAddress.js just add another one directly below the 2 social icons in the hero section, make it say coming soon with a clipboard icon to the right of it instead of a copy ca  text

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add another contract address input to the hero section, below the social icons. They want it to be the same as the one in ContractAddress.js, but with some modifications:
1. Make it say "Coming Soon" 
2. Add a clipboard icon to the right instead of the "Copy Contract Address" text

Let me first look at the ContractAddress.js component to understand the structure, then I'll need to check if there's a clipboard/copy icon available in the icons folder.

Looking at the ContractAddress.js:
- It has a black rounded container with dashed border
- White background with text inside
- A button with hover effects
- Currently shows "COMING SOON!" in the address field

I need to:
1. Import the Copy icon (if available)
2. Add the contract address section below the social icons
3. Modify it to show "Coming Soon" with a clipboard icon instead of the button text</details></think>

I'll add a contract address section below the social icons in the hero section, using the same styling as your existing ContractAddress component but with a clipboard icon instead of the copy button text.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully added the contract address section to the hero component with the following features:

1. **Added "use client" directive**: Since the component now has client-side functionality (copy to clipboard)

2. **Imported Copy icon**: Added the Copy icon to the imports

3. **Added handleCopyClick function**: Same functionality as the original ContractAddress component

4. **Contract Address Section**: 
   - Positioned below the social icons
   - Uses the same styling as ContractAddress.js (black container with dashed cosmic-cyan border)
   - Shows "Coming Soon" text
   - Has a clipboard icon to the right that changes color on hover
   - Responsive design with max-width

5. **Adjusted spacing**: Increased bottom margin on social icons to accommodate the new section

The styling matches the original ContractAddress component but is more compact and integrated into the hero layout. The clipboard icon is positioned to the right and has hover effects with the cosmic color scheme.</details></think>

add a smaller text disclaimer saying This website is still under heav y development. Everything is subject to change

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add a disclaimer text to the hero section saying "This website is still under heavy development. Everything is subject to change". I should add this as a smaller text, probably at the bottom of the hero section, maybe after the contract address section. I'll use smaller font size and maybe a muted color to make it clear it's a disclaimer.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've added the disclaimer text at the bottom of the hero section. The changes I made:

1. Added `mb-8` to the contract address section to create space for the disclaimer
2. Added the disclaimer text with appropriate styling:
   - `text-sm` for smaller text size
   - `text-gray-400` for muted gray color
   - `font-mono` to match the design consistency
   - `max-w-lg mx-auto` for responsive centering
   - `opacity-75` to make it more subtle
   - The exact text requested: "This website is still under heavy development. Everything is subject to change."

The disclaimer is now positioned at the bottom of the hero section and styled appropriately to be noticeable but not intrusive.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added the disclaimer text at the bottom of the hero section with the following styling:

## ‚úÖ **Added Disclaimer:**

- **Text**: "This website is still under heavy development. Everything is subject to change."
- **Styling**: 
  - Small text size (`text-sm`)
  - Muted gray color (`text-gray-400`)
  - Mono font for consistency (`font-mono`)
  - Subtle opacity (`opacity-75`)
  - Responsive centering (`max-w-lg mx-auto`)

## üé® **Spacing Adjustments:**
- Added `mb-8` to the contract address section to create proper spacing
- Positioned at the very bottom of the hero content

The disclaimer is now clearly visible but styled subtly so it doesn't interfere with the main hero content, while still being informative for users about the development status! üìù

fix this color contrast  in the The Great Awakening
 Booty Bounce Protocol
 in @Roadmap.js 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing me a screenshot of the roadmap section and asking about color contrast issues. Looking at the Roadmap.js file, I can see that there are roadmap events with different styling based on whether they're completed or not.

Looking at the code:
- For completed events: `bg-cosmic-pink/20 border-cosmic-pink shadow-lg shadow-cosmic-pink/20`
- For not completed events: `bg-cosmic-cyan/10 border-cosmic-cyan/30 shadow-lg shadow-cosmic-cyan/10`

The title styling is:
```jsx
<h3 className="font-stopbuck text-2xl text-cosmic-coral text-shadow-peach">
  {event.title}
</h3>
```

And the description:
```jsx
<p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
  {event.description}
</p>
```

From the user's screenshot, it looks like the text might be hard to read against the background. The issue is likely that the text colors (cosmic-coral for titles, white/90 for descriptions) don't have enough contrast against the background colors.

Looking at the CSS variables:
- cosmic-pink: #FB2AA3
- cosmic-coral: #FE6040
- cosmic-cyan: #06E3F5

The text-shadow-peach uses #FE6040 which is the same as cosmic-coral, so there might be poor contrast there.

I should fix the text colors to have better contrast against the backgrounds.</details></think>

I can see the color contrast issue in the roadmap cards. The text colors aren't providing enough contrast against the background colors. Let me fix this by improving the text colors for better readability.

                        <span>Completed</span>
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I made several improvements to fix the color contrast issues:

1. **Title text**: Changed from `text-cosmic-coral text-shadow-peach` to solid `text-white` with `font-bold` for better contrast against both completed and non-completed card backgrounds.

2. **Description text**: Changed from `text-white/90` to `text-gray-200` for better readability.

3. **Completion indicator**: Changed from `text-cosmic-pink` to `text-cosmic-cyan` for better contrast against the pink background of completed items.

4. **Phase text**: Kept as `text-cosmic-cyan` since it already had good contrast.

The main issue was that the cosmic-coral color (#FE6040) with the peach text shadow wasn't providing enough contrast against the pink/coral backgrounds. Using white text with bold font weight will provide much better readability against both the pink (completed) and cyan (not completed) card backgrounds.</details></think>

Perfect! I've fixed the color contrast issues in the roadmap section:

## ‚úÖ **Color Contrast Improvements:**

1. **Title Text**: 
   - Changed from `text-cosmic-coral text-shadow-peach` to `text-white font-bold`
   - Now provides excellent contrast against both completed (pink) and pending (cyan) card backgrounds

2. **Description Text**: 
   - Changed from `text-white/90` to `text-gray-200`
   - Better readability while maintaining the design aesthetic

3. **Completion Status**: 
   - Changed from `text-cosmic-pink` to `text-cosmic-cyan`
   - Better contrast against the pink background of completed cards

4. **Phase Text**: 
   - Kept as `text-cosmic-cyan` since it already had good contrast

The roadmap cards now have much better readability with proper contrast ratios. The white titles with bold font weight will stand out clearly against both the pink (completed) and cyan (pending) card backgrounds, making "The Great Awakening" and "Booty Bounce Protocol" much easier to read! üéØ
