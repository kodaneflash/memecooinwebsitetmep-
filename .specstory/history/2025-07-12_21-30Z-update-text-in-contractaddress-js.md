_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:

1. Replace some text "D] you are duis-dawg!‍ Welcome to the Duis family!" to be more related to their theme
2. Remove the contract address "8J5r6kteet9Cm6waM2MWB2SNeu97CZ1jTKSDG76MoON" from ContractAddress.js and make it say "coming soon!"

First, I need to find where this text "D] you are duis-dawg!‍ Welcome to the Duis family!" is located. It's not in the Nav.js or ContractAddress.js files that were provided. Let me search for it in the codebase.

Then I need to modify the ContractAddress.js file to remove the contract address and replace it with "coming soon!".

Let me start by searching for that text to understand what the current theme is.</details></think>

I'll help you replace that text and update the contract address. Let me first search for the text you mentioned to understand the current theme better.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I found the text in the HowToBuy.js file. Now let me also search for the "Welcome to the Duis family!" text to see if it's in the same component or elsewhere.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The "Welcome to the Duis family!" text wasn't found. Let me read the HowToBuy.js file to see the context of the text that needs to be replaced and understand the theme better.</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/HowToBuy.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the text that needs to be replaced. The user wants me to replace:
- The title: "you are duis-dawg!‍"
- The content: "Welcome to the Duis family!"

I need to understand what the current theme is to replace it with something more appropriate. Looking at the codebase, I can see references to:
- $JIATsr (from the Nav.js Buy button)
- The project seems to be a meme coin website

Let me also check other components to understand the theme better.</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/Hero.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me check more components to understand the theme better. Let me look at the About component and others to understand what the coin/project is actually about.</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/About.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I understand the theme completely. The project is about:
- JIAT (Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token) 
- It's a cosmic/space-themed meme coin
- The theme is about "Planet Jiggletron" and "jiggle power"
- It's built on Solana

So I need to replace the "duis-dawg" and "Duis family" text with something related to JIAT and the cosmic jiggle theme.

Now let me make the changes:

1. First, I'll update the HowToBuy.js file to replace the "duis-dawg" text with something JIAT-themed
2. Then I'll update the ContractAddress.js file to show "coming soon!" instead of the contract address

Let me update both files now.</details></think>

---

Now I understand the theme! Your project is about JIAT (Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token) with a cosmic/space theme. Let me update both files to match this theme.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully updated both files:

1. **HowToBuy.js**: Changed "you are duis-dawg!" to "you are a cosmic jiggler!" and "Duis family" to "JIAT galaxy" - this matches the cosmic theme of the JIAT (Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token) project.

2. **ContractAddress.js**: Replaced the contract address "8J5r6kteet9Cm6waM2MWB2SNeu97CZ1jTKSDG76MoON" with "COMING SOON!" as requested.

The changes align perfectly with the cosmic/space theme of the project that features Planet Jiggletron and jiggle power.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully updated both files to match your JIAT (Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token) theme:

## Changes Made:

1. **HowToBuy.js**: 
   - Changed "you are duis-dawg!" → "you are a cosmic jiggler!"
   - Changed "Duis family" → "JIAT galaxy"

2. **ContractAddress.js**:
   - Replaced the contract address with "COMING SOON!"

The new text now perfectly aligns with your cosmic/space theme featuring Planet Jiggletron and the jiggle power concept. The "cosmic jiggler" and "JIAT galaxy" terminology matches the intergalactic theme established in your About section.
