replace this text Dui, affectionately known as the "meme dog" captured the hearts of millions worldwide with his one-of-a-kind appearance and hilariously expressive face.

His photos first went viral in early 2020, became an instant internet sensation. People adored his quirky expressions, which seemed to perfectly match countless relatable moods, turning Dui into a staple of internet humor.

His lovable nature brought joy and laughter to a global audience during challenging times, making him a symbol of light-hearted fun.

Unfortunately ü•π, Dui passed away on October 18, 2023, after a tragic snakeüêç bite.

 with In a distant corner of the galaxy, beyond the Milky Way, lies a secret cosmic phenomenon: Planet Jiggletron. This whimsical planet pulsates rhythmically through space, powered entirely by the infinite jiggling energy of its intergalactic inhabitants‚Äô rear ends. To harness this endless, cheek-driven force, the Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token (JIAT) was born‚Äîbringing unstoppable energy, humor, and decentralized jiggle economics to the Solana galaxy.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to replace some text in the project. Looking at the git status, I can see that several files have been modified, including components like About.js, Hero.js, and other landing page components. 

The text they want to replace seems to be about a "meme dog" named Dui, and they want to replace it with content about "Planet Jiggletron" and the "Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token (JIAT)". This appears to be for a meme coin landing page.

I need to:
1. First find where this text currently exists in the codebase
2. Replace it with the new text they provided

Let me search for this text in the codebase.</details></think>

I'll help you replace that text. Let me first search for where this text currently exists in your codebase.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Found it! The text is in the About.js component. Let me read that file to see the current content and understand the context better.</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/About.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I found the text that needs to be replaced. It's in the About.js component, specifically in the paragraphs starting from line 26. I need to replace the content with the new text about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT. 

The structure shows:
- A header about "D√∫i" 
- Three paragraphs in the main content area
- A final section at the bottom

I'll need to replace the three main paragraphs (lines 26-44) with the new content about Planet Jiggletron. I should also update the title and other references to match the new theme.

Let me make these changes:</details></think>

---

Now I'll replace the text with the new content about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT. I'll update the About component to reflect the new theme.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Now I need to replace the main content paragraphs with the new text about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT. I'll replace the three paragraphs that describe Dui with the new content.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the final section at the bottom. The current text mentions Dui passing away and being on Solana. I should update this to reflect the new theme about JIAT and Planet Jiggletron being on Solana.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully replaced all the text about Dui with the new content about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT. The changes include:

1. Updated the title from "About D√∫i" to "About JIAT"
2. Updated the subtitle from "(Nguyen Van Dui)" to "(Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token)"
3. Replaced the three paragraphs about Dui with the new content about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT
4. Updated the final section to reflect JIAT bringing cosmic jiggle power to Solana

The text replacement is complete and maintains the same styling and structure as the original component.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully replaced all the text about Dui with the new content about Planet Jiggletron and JIAT. Here's what I changed in the About component:

1. **Title**: Changed from "About D√∫i" to "About JIAT"
2. **Subtitle**: Updated from "(Nguyen Van Dui)" to "(Jiggly Intergalactic Ass Token)"
3. **Main content**: Replaced the three paragraphs about Dui with your new text about Planet Jiggletron and the cosmic jiggle energy concept
4. **Final section**: Updated to reflect JIAT bringing cosmic jiggle power to Solana

The component now tells the story of Planet Jiggletron and how JIAT harnesses the infinite jiggling energy for decentralized jiggle economics on the Solana blockchain. All the styling and structure remain the same, maintaining the visual consistency of your meme coin landing page.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing me an error that indicates "The default export is not a React Component in "/page"". This suggests there's an issue with the page.js file in the app/(landing) directory - it's not properly exporting a React component as the default export.

Let me check the current state of the page.js file to see what's causing this error.</details></think>

---

I can see the error is related to the page component not having a proper default export. Let me check the current state of the page.js file to identify and fix the issue.

---

Read file: app/(landing)/page.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue! The page.js file is missing the default export statement. The component `LandingPage` is defined but it's not being exported as the default export. In Next.js, page components must have a default export.

I need to add `export default LandingPage;` at the end of the file.</details></think>

---

I found the issue! The page.js file is missing the default export statement. The `LandingPage` component is defined but not exported, which is causing the error. Let me fix this:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've added the missing default export statement to the page.js file. This should resolve the error "The default export is not a React Component in "/page"" that was occurring because Next.js requires page components to have a default export.

The fix is simple - I just added `export default LandingPage;` at the end of the file, which properly exports the `LandingPage` component as the default export that Next.js expects.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the error by adding the missing default export statement to the page.js file. The issue was that the `LandingPage` component was defined but not exported, which caused Next.js to throw the error "The default export is not a React Component in "/page"".

The fix was simple - I added `export default LandingPage;` at the end of the file. Now Next.js can properly recognize and render the page component. Your application should now work without the 500 error.
