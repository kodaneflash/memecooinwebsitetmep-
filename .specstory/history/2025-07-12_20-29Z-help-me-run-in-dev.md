<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see from the user's output that they're trying to run `npm run dev` and getting a "sh: next: command not found" error. This suggests that their Node.js dependencies aren't installed. Looking at the package.json, I can see they have Next.js 15.0.3 as a dependency, but it seems like node_modules isn't installed.

The solution is to run `npm install` first to install the dependencies, then `npm run dev` should work.

Let me help them with this.</details></think>

I can see the issue! The error "sh: next: command not found" indicates that the Node.js dependencies haven't been installed yet. You need to install the dependencies first before running the development server.

Let me help you install the dependencies and then start the development server:

---

```bash
npm install
```

```

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has moved the npm install command to the background, which means it's running. Since the next command will be in a new shell, I should wait for the installation to complete before trying to run the dev server. Let me check</details></think>
