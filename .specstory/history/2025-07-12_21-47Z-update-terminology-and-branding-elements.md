_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to make two changes:

1. Change the word "tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics" 
2. Add the word "The Jiggleverse" above the social links

Let me first search for where "tokenomics" is used in the codebase, and then find where the social links are located.

I need to:
1. Find where "tokenomics" appears in the codebase
2. Find where the social links are located 
3. Make the necessary changes

Let me start by searching for "tokenomics" and "social" to understand the current structure.</details></think>

---

I'll help you make those changes. Let me first search for where "tokenomics" appears in the codebase and locate the social links.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I can see the current structure. From the search results, I can see:

1. **Tokenomics** appears in several places that need to be changed to "Jigglenomics":
   - `app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js` - The component file itself, in the component name, the title, and the description
   - `app/(landing)/_components/Nav.js` - In the navigation menu
   - `app/(landing)/page.js` - In the import and usage

2. **Social links** are in the `app/(landing)/_components/Socials.js` file, and from the search results, it appears to be rendered as a standalone component in the main page.

Let me first read the current Socials.js component to understand its structure so I can add "The Jiggleverse" above it, and then examine the Tokenomics-related files to make the changes.</details></think>

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/Socials.js

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js

---

Read file: app/(landing)/_components/Nav.js

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the current structure. I need to make the following changes:

1. **Change "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"** in:
   - `app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js` - The title text and subtitle text
   - `app/(landing)/_components/Nav.js` - The navigation link text

2. **Add "The Jiggleverse" above the social links** in:
   - `app/(landing)/_components/Socials.js` - I can see there's a hidden heading "Socials" but I need to add "The Jiggleverse" above the social links

For the Tokenomics component, I need to:
- Change the main title "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"
- Update the subtitle from "It's Moonshot tokenomics!" to "It's Moonshot jigglenomics!" (or similar)

For the Nav component, I need to:
- Change the navigation item from "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"

For the Socials component, I need to:
- Add "The Jiggleverse" as a heading above the social links
- I can see the current "Socials" heading is hidden, so I should replace it with "The Jiggleverse" and make it visible

Let me make these changes now.</details></think>

---

Now I'll make the requested changes. Let me update the files to:

1. Change "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics" in the navigation and component
2. Add "The Jiggleverse" above the social links

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully made all the requested changes:

1. **Changed "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics":**
   - In `app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js`: Changed the main title from "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"
   - In `app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js`: Updated the subtitle from "It's Moonshot tokenomics!" to "It's Moonshot jigglenomics!"
   - In `app/(landing)/_components/Nav.js`: Changed the navigation link from "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"

2. **Added "The Jiggleverse" above the social links:**
   - In `app/(landing)/_components/Socials.js`: Replaced the hidden "Socials" heading with "The Jiggleverse" and made it visible by removing the `hidden` class and adding proper spacing with `my-16`

All changes have been applied successfully. The user's requests have been fully implemented:
- "Tokenomics" has been changed to "Jigglenomics" throughout the application
- "The Jiggleverse" now appears above the social links as a prominent heading

The changes maintain the existing styling and layout while incorporating the new branding elements the user requested.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully made both changes you requested:

## Changes Made:

### 1. Changed "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics":
- **`app/(landing)/_components/Tokenomics.js`**: Updated the main title and subtitle text
- **`app/(landing)/_components/Nav.js`**: Changed the navigation menu item from "Tokenomics" to "Jigglenomics"

### 2. Added "The Jiggleverse" above social links:
- **`app/(landing)/_components/Socials.js`**: Replaced the hidden "Socials" heading with "The Jiggleverse" and made it visible with proper spacing

The changes maintain the existing styling and layout while incorporating your new branding elements. The "Jigglenomics" section will now display with the updated title, and visitors will see "The Jiggleverse" prominently displayed above the social media links.
